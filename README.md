# NLP-Multi-label-Classification-Project
This project aims to classify text data into multiple categories using various deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Bidirectional RNNs (Bi-RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bidirectional GRU (Bi-GRU).
